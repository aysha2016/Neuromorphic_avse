# Neuromorphic Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE)

## üß† Project Overview
This project explores neuromorphic computing principles to enhance speech using both audio and visual inputs. The model simulates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for biologically-inspired processing, combining audio and lip movement data for effective speech enhancement.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure
- `dataset/`: Preprocessing utilities and sample video location
- `models/`: Core spiking neural network encoder and decoder
- `utils/`: Audio/visual processing utilities
- `main.py`: Main pipeline to process and enhance a video
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Add a sample video named `sample_video.mp4` to the `dataset/` folder.
2. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## üí° Notes
- Simulates audio-visual SNN encoding and decoding.
- Audio features: MFCC (Librosa)
- Visual features: Grayscale frames (OpenCV)
- Placeholder modules to demonstrate neuromorphic principles.
