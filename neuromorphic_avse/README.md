# Neuromorphic Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a biologically-inspired approach to speech enhancement using neuromorphic computing principles. By simulating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we combine audio and visual inputs to enhance speech quality, mimicking the natural integration of auditory and visual cues in human perception.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Neuromorphic Processing**: Implements SNN-based encoder-decoder architecture for biologically plausible signal processing
- **Multimodal Integration**: Seamlessly combines audio waveforms with lip movement features
- **Bio-inspired Architecture**: 
  - Temporal encoding of audio-visual features using spike trains
  - Event-driven processing for efficient computation
  - Adaptive synaptic plasticity for learning temporal patterns
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete workflow from video input to enhanced speech output

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Encoder**:
  - Audio Branch: Converts MFCC features to spike trains
  - Visual Branch: Processes lip movements into temporal spike patterns
  - Cross-modal Integration: Biologically plausible fusion of audio-visual streams
- **Decoder**:
  - Spike-to-speech conversion
  - Temporal alignment of enhanced features
  - Waveform reconstruction
